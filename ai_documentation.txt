PROMPT: I am getting this error on Jupyter Datahub: (nlp-P02)jupyter-ckshimazaki[proj02-group08]> python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm /srv/conda/envs/notebook/bin/python: No module named spacy How do I resolve it 
OUTPUT: You’re getting:
No module named spacy
This means your conda environment inside Datahub does NOT have spaCy installed, even though the project PDF assumes it.
This is very normal on Datahub — you just need to install spaCy inside your current environment.
Here’s exactly what to do. ✅ Step 1 — Install spaCy
Run this in the Datahub terminal (the same one where you saw the error):
pip install spacy
This may take ~1–2 minutes.✅ Step 2 — Download the language model
After spaCy installs successfully, run:
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
You should now see something like:
✔ Download and installation successful
