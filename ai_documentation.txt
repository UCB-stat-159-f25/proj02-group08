PROMPT: if I want to pull a repository with changes that is already if my Jupyter hub what do I do? do I use git pull https://github.com/UCB-stat-159-f25/proj02-group08.git?
OUTPUT: DO NOT use the full GitHub URL.
You just run: git pull

[nlp-P02.ipynb for Part 02 of proj02-nlp.ipynb]
PROMPT: I am getting this error on Jupyter Datahub: (nlp-P02)jupyter-ckshimazaki[proj02-group08]> python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm /srv/conda/envs/notebook/bin/python: No module named spacy How do I resolve it 
OUTPUT: You’re getting:
No module named spacy
This means your conda environment inside Datahub does NOT have spaCy installed, even though the project PDF assumes it.
This is very normal on Datahub — you just need to install spaCy inside your current environment.
Here’s exactly what to do. ✅ Step 1 — Install spaCy
Run this in the Datahub terminal (the same one where you saw the error):
pip install spacy
This may take ~1–2 minutes.✅ Step 2 — Download the language model
After spaCy installs successfully, run:
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
You should now see something like:
✔ Download and installation successful


PROMPT: How do I use plt.savefig() and its parameters
OUTPUT: Here’s a tiny crash course on plt.savefig 👇
1. Basic idea
plt.savefig saves the current figure to a file.
plt.savefig("figure.png")
Saves to the current working directory.
Format is taken from the extension (.png, .pdf, .svg, …).
2. Most useful parameters
plt.savefig("path/to/file.png",
            dpi=300,            # resolution (higher = sharper)
            bbox_inches="tight",# trims extra whitespace
            transparent=False)  # True = no background
dpi: 100–150 for quick plots, 300 for reports.
bbox_inches="tight": prevents axis labels from being cut off.
transparent=True: useful for slides / overlaying.
3. Saving into a specific folder
From a notebook in notebooks/, to save into repo-root outputs/:
import os
os.makedirs("../outputs", exist_ok=True)

plt.savefig("../outputs/my_plot.png", dpi=300, bbox_inches="tight")
That’s basically all you need 95% of the time.

PROMPT: What color maps in seaborn go from orange to purple

OUTPUT: Good question! Here are the seaborn colormaps that go from orange to purple (or similar warm-to-cool transitions):
Seaborn Perceptually Uniform Colormaps
1. "rocket" - Dark purple → orange/peach

Starts: Dark purple/black
Ends: Light orange/peach
Good for: Sequential data with warm highlights

2. "mako" - Dark purple → light green

Starts: Dark purple/black
Ends: Light green/mint
Good for: Sequential data with cool tones

3. "flare" - Dark purple → orange/yellow

Starts: Dark purple
Ends: Bright orange/yellow
Good for: Sequential data, similar to rocket but brighter

[nlp-P03.ipynb for Part 03 of proj02-nlp.ipynb]
PROMPT:I activated my conda env but my notebook is not using it. How do I make my notebook recognize the environment as a kernel?
OUTPUT: 
To use your conda environment in Jupyter, first activate it in the terminal, then register it with:
python -m ipykernel install --user --name sotu --display-name 'IPython - sotu'
After that, open your notebook and switch to this kernel through Kernel → Change Kernel. This ensures the notebook uses your environment and the packages installed in it.
