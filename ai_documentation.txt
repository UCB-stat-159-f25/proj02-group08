PROMPT:I activated my conda env but my notebook is not using it. How do I make my notebook recognize the environment as a kernel?
OUTPUT: 
To use your conda environment in Jupyter, first activate it in the terminal, then register it with:
python -m ipykernel install --user --name sotu --display-name 'IPython - sotu'
After that, open your notebook and switch to this kernel through Kernel → Change Kernel. This ensures the notebook uses your environment and the packages installed in it.
