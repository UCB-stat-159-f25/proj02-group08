    "1. Process speeches using the SpaCy nlp module\n",
    "2. Analyze Tokens vs Lemmas:\n",
    "- Create a list of all tokens across all speeches that are not stop words, punctuation, or spaces.\n",
    "- Create a second list of the lemmas for these same tokens.\n",
    "- Display the top 25 for each of these and compare.\n",
    "3. Analyze common word distributions over different years:\n",
    "- Create a function that takes the dataset and a year as an input and outputs the top n lemmas for that year's speeches\n",
    "- Compare the top 10 words for 2023 versus 2019\n",
